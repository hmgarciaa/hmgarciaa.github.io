My work integrates environmental data, spatial analysis, and adminstrative records to identify patterns of repetitive flood exposure and to assess how these experiences shape migration, adaptation, and community resilience.\nI am currently a PhD candidate in the Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program (E3P) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nYou can download a PDF of my CV here."
