I am an early-career scientist studying the impacts of climate change and natural hazards, with a focus on how flooding affects people and communities. My work integrates environmental data, spatial analysis, and adminstrative records to identify patterns of repetitive flood exposure and to assess how these experiences shape migration, adaptation, and community resilience.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program (E3P)](https://e3p.unc.edu/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
